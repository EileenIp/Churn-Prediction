## Problem Statement

**Project Description:**
The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model for churn prediction in the telecom industry. Churn prediction is crucial for telecom companies to retain customers and maintain profitability. By leveraging logistic regression, we aim to analyze historical customer data and predict the likelihood of a customer churning. This model will assist telecom companies in taking proactive measures to retain at-risk customers and enhance their services, ultimately reducing churn rates and increasing customer satisfaction.

**Key Objectives:**
- Build a predictive model using logistic regression.
- Analyze historical customer data to identify patterns leading to churn.
- Develop a tool for telecom companies to predict and reduce churn.
- Contribute to the telecom industry's efforts to improve customer retention and service quality.

**Project Highlights:**
- Utilizes machine learning to address a real-world problem in the telecom sector.
- Enhances customer retention strategies.
- Promotes data-driven decision-making in the industry.

## Conclusion

The Churn Prediction in Telecom Industry project revealed key insights:

- **Customer Demographics:** The dataset presents a near-even distribution of male and female customers, with a relatively small percentage (16%) being senior citizens.

- **Partners and Dependents:** Roughly 50% of customers have a partner, while only 30% have dependents, suggesting a predominantly single customer base.

- **Contract Patterns:** Many opt for short one-month contracts, while a significant number stay for around 72 months.

- **Contract Types:** The majority favor month-to-month contracts, with notable numbers choosing one-year or two-year terms. Month-to-month customers exhibit a higher churn rate.

- **Billing Impact:** Total charges correlate with higher monthly bills, and customers with high monthly charges tend to churn more.

- **Churn Rates:** 74% of customers do not churn, especially those with longer tenure. Higher-aged customers exhibit higher churn rates.

- **Machine Learning Insights:** Hyperparameter tuning significantly improved the Logistic Regression model, demonstrated higher precision, recall, accuracy, ROC-AUC, and F1 scores. Achieving an impressive 78% accuracy and recall on the test dataset.

The project has provided valuable insights into customer behavior, churn patterns, and the impact of various factors on customer retention. These findings can inform strategic decisions and customer-focused initiatives within the telecom industry.
